# Ecommerce-clothing-recommendation-prediction

**Goal : Predicting Ecommerce cloth Recommendation & Analyzing the reviews**

**Dataset** : [Kaggle women ecommerce clothing review](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews)

## Motivation

1. Suggesting the business to significant words for recommended products
2. Suggesting the business to important categories and influencing factors in recommendedation
3. What kind of categories people have more negative reviews and what are they try to say
4. Correlation between Negative review and Recommendation

## Methodology



*Optional : using Words embedding to combine the features [keras]*

## Aim for each phase

- **Data Analysis :** Experiment our Business hypothesis with dataset. Find the pattens in dataset. Plan for Feature Engineering.
- **Data Preprocess :** Based on insights, start with preprocessing. Apply all regular NLP feature engineering (Tokens, stemming, lower letter and trimming). Apply TF-IDF & Bag of words for each words
- **Model Building & Validation :** Apply all possible models and validate with that. Validate with Cross matrix initially. It is efficient and easy to interpret more metrics.
- **Business Inference :** Try to interpret the results from modelt result. for `objective 3` , use topic modelling and extract the topics.
